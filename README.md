# Python-Planet-Simulation

A simulation of planets and their orbits around the sun in Python.

## Installation

1) Install Python from [here](https://python.org/downloads/)
2) Install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3) Open cmd.exe/shell and `cd` to the directory you wanna install the program
4) Type `git clone https://github.com/Oakchris1955/PyGame-Planet-Simulation`
5) `cd` to the directory created by typing `cd PyGame-Planet-Simulation`
6) Type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` for Windows or `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the prerequisites
7) That's it. Now all you have to do is run `main.py`

### What is this?

This is a fork of [techwithtim](https://github.com/techwithtim)'s repository about [Making a Planet Simulation with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTLPmUHTPqo). It adds some extra features.

### What extras does it have?

1) Click a planet to select it
2) Planet are viewed on their actual size
3) You can drag the screen...
4) ...and you can zoom in and out too
5) To reduce lag, only some recent parts of the orbit are drawn, while the other fade away. This reduces lag by a lot
6) And more features are expected to come
